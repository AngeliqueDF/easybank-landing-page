## Description

So you had an idea and developed the next world's industry-changing application. You decided to open-source it because you're way cool. Now you need to educate people about your project and need some docs to get started. You got it. :alien:

### How I built this project

1. Frontend
   1. Start by structuring the page with semantic and accessible HTML. Check W3C compliance with the website or extension.
   2. Style the page with a mobile-first approach.
   3. Add functionality with JavaScript.
2. Backend
   1. Middlewares (security, error handlers, utility)
   2. Write Routes
   3. (Write tests if they weren't already written)

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
